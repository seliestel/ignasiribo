    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As the environmental crisis continues to intensify, driven by human impacts on the sustainability of the Earth’s ecosystems and on the stability of the planet as a whole, posthumanism seeks to undermine the legacies of humanism in an effort to explore from a non-anthropocentric perspective the ongoing entanglements of humans and non-humans. Emerging and diverse approaches to the human, the nonhuman, the inhuman, and the posthuman have been at the centre of recent work in ecocriticism and across the environmental humanities. Many scholars view posthumanism as a paradigmatic change that is not only reconfiguring academic knowledge about naturecultures, but also giving rise to new and unexpected ways of being-together in a more-than-human world.</p>
    <p>Ecocritics and other scholars interested in Southeast Asia are also actively pursuing posthumanist explorations of cultural engagements across species and various other boundaries. After all, this is a region where humans and nonhumans have always been deeply entangled, from the indigeneous and ancient traditions of animism to the variegated and blooming creativity of contemporary literature, art, music, drama, film, and other media.</p>
    <p>In this international conference, we want to explore and discuss all these naturalcultural entanglements, the various ways in which we can speak of a posthuman Southeast Asia. But we also hope to provide a forum where scholars based or working on Southeast Asia may contribute to the global conversation on the posthumanities.</p>
